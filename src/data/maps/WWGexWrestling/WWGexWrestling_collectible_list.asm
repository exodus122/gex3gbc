; Rendered from data/maps/WWGexWrestling/WWGexWrestling_collectible_list.bin
; by tools/render_map_asm.py, per the collectible_list layout in tools/map_formats.json.
;
; The .bin is the editable source of truth for the bytes; this file is a
; generated view of it that happens to be what gets assembled. To change the
; data, edit the .bin (a map editor writes it). To change what a field MEANS,
; edit the schema. Either way, `make maps-docs` refreshes this file; hand edits
; are overwritten on the next build.
;
; One level's collectibles, in 16x16-pixel grid cells. The third byte is the map
; id - a gex3 level is many maps, which is the whole difference from gex2's
; two-byte record.
;
; call_00_2f85_CollectibleList_LoadForCurrentLevel builds the same per-column
; index tables gex2 does, and call_00_2f34_CountLevelCollectibleTotal walks this
; list for the HUD denominator - counting until a record whose X is zero, then
; adding the entities whose type drops a collectible when defeated.
;
; The terminating record is $00 $00 COLLECTIBLE_LIST_END; anything after it is
; padding.
;
; Record layout - 3 bytes, COLLECTIBLE_RECORD_SIZE:
;   +0   db  grid_x, grid_y, map_id   - grid x, grid y, then the map it belongs to
;
; 0 records.
